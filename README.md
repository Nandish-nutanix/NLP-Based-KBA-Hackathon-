# NLP-Based KBA Integration

The primary objective of this project is to automate the handling of Knowledge Bases (KBs) for troubleshooting solutions using NLP, thereby eliminating the need for manual intervention. The aim is to create an integrated KB system capable of executing the necessary steps automatically, with users required only to monitor the process.

## Objectives and Components

### 1. Dataset Creation
The dataset will initially use static data from 2-3 KBs and should include the following elements:

#### 1.1 KBA Information Extraction
- **Inputs/Arguments - System Configuration Mapping**: Captures key configuration details such as:
  - Nodes
  - Clusters
  - Username
  - Password
- **Actions**: Specifies operations to be executed, such as:
  - Logging into nodes
  - Downloading files
  - Executing predefined actions
- **Sequence**: 
  - Identifies generic KBs applicable across cases.
  - Determines the KBs to extract based on minor variations in inputs.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Establishes a dependency matrix detailing relationships between tasks and components.
- **Validations**:
  - Defines expected results for each action and step to ensure correctness.

### 2. Solution Display
- **Consent**: 
  - Presents potential solutions to the user, outlining how each solution will be executed and its expected outcomes.

### 3. Automated Execution on Testbed/Setup
- Automatically executes the defined KB steps on a testbed environment, applying the identified KB solutions.

### 4. Summary and Result Display
- Provides a summary of the actions performed and the final outcomes for user review.

## Key Features
1. **Streamlined Troubleshooting**: Reduces manual effort by automating KB interactions.
2. **Scalability**: Initial focus on a small dataset allows for scalability to a broader range of KBs.
3. **Transparency**: Ensures users have visibility into proposed solutions and executed actions.
4. **Validation-Driven Execution**: Built-in validation at every step to ensure accuracy and reliability.
